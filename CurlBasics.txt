Curl Options--
The advantage of CURL is its tool independent, we dont need to install any tool specifically. 

curl [options] [URL...]

Here are the options that we’ll use when making requests:

-X, --request - The HTTP method to be used.
-i, --include - Include the response headers.
-d, --data - The data to be sent. (payload)
-H, --header - Additional header to be sent.
-u, --user to send username password, if its a basic authentication
other authentications can be passed as headers
-o,		output option to save to a file:
-v, --verbose : the opposite of --silent gives more details about the request and response
-s, --silent : silent or quiet mode

HEAD requests

curl -I https://www.bookmarks.dev/api/public/bookmarks
curl -i -X HEAD https://www.bookmarks.dev/api/public/bookmarks

curl -I https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

HTTP GET

The GET method requests a specific resource from the server.

GET is the default method when making HTTP requests with curl. 
Executing curl with no parameters on a URL (resource) will execute a GET.
Here is an example of making a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API to a JSON representation of all posts:

curl https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

curl https://www.bookmarks.dev/api/version

curl -X GET "https://www.bookmarks.dev/api/version" -H "accept: application/json"

If you don’t want the progress meter (first part) shown, you can silent curl:

$ curl https://www.bookmarks.dev/api/version -s
{"version":"13.0.0","gitSha1":"1469201f6b6d56408ff98418842d4a933402cd93"}


To filter the results use query params:

curl https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1
(Parameters must be passed in the URL itself)

HTTP POST
The POST method is used to create a resource on the server. If the resource exists, it is overridden.

The following command makes a POST request using the data specified with the -d option:

curl -X POST -d "userId=5&title=Hello World&body=Post body." https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

The type of the request body is specified using the Content-Type header. 
By default when this header is not given curl uses Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

To send a JSON formatted data set the body type to application/json:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"userId": 5, "title": "Hello World", "body": "Post body."}' \
    https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId": 5, "title": "Hello World", "body": "Post body."}'  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts


HTTP PUT
The PUT method is used to update or replace a resource on the server. It replaces all data of the specified resource with the request data.

curl -X PUT -d "userId=5&title=Hello World&body=Post body." https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/5
HTTP PATCH
The PUT method is used to make partial updates to the resource on the server.

curl -X PUT -d "title=Hello Universe" https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/5
HTTP DELETE
The DELETE method removes the specified resource from the server.

curl -X DELETE https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/5
Authentication
If the API endpoint requires authentication, you’ll need to obtain an access key. Otherwise, the API server will respond with the “Access Forbidden” or “Unauthorized” response message.

The process of obtaining an access key depends on the API you’re using. Once you have your access token you can send it in the header:

curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" "https://api.server.io/posts"
